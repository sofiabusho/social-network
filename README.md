Suggested Work Order

Start with Part 1 - Everyone needs the database and authentication working
Parts 2 and 3 can work in parallel once Part 1 is done
Part 4 starts last but can begin planning/setup earlier

Integration Points to Coordinate

Part 1 creates the user tables that Parts 2, 3, 4 will use
Part 2's following system affects Part 3's post privacy and Part 4's messaging permissions
Part 4 needs user data from Part 1, following data from Part 2, and group data from Part 3

Each person should create clear API documentation for their endpoints so others can integrate easily. Consider having regular sync meetings to ensure the parts work together smoothly.
